MONOLITHIC: in monolithic we use single sever and single db for multiple services
MICRO SERVICE: in micro service we use multiple servers and multiple dbs for multiple services
                ( we have to choose the architecture based on aplication and its services)

In micro services we do not use servers, we use containers.
CONTAINER: container is virtual machine without having OS
DOCKER: it is a tool used to create a container, and the container uses IMAGE which is having os&packages already installed(pre built).
                            SERVER = VM = CONTAINER
                                      
DOCKER:
      it is a open source entralized platform designed to create, deploy and run the application
      docker is written in GO language
      docker creates containers on host os to run application
      we can install docker in any os but docker engine runs natively on linux distributions.
      It allows applications to use the same Linux kernel as a system on the host computer, rather than creating a whole virtual O.S.
      Before Docker performs O.S level Virtualization also known as Containerization. process of packing application along with its dependencies.
      It was initially released in March 2013, and developed by Solomon Hykes and Sebastian Pahl.
      Docker is a set of platform-as-a-service that use O.S level Virtualization, where as VM ware uses Hardware level Virtualization.
      Container have O.S files but its negligible in size compared to original files of that O.S.
COMPONANTS:
       CLIENT: It takes the commands and executes with communication docker daemon
       HOST: The place where you installed docker.
       DAEMON: Deals with docker componets(images, containers, volumes ----). it is inside docker host.
       REGISTRY: It stores all the Images.

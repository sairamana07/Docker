MONOLITHIC: in monolithic we use single sever and single db for multiple services
MICRO SERVICE: in micro service we use multiple servers and multiple dbs for multiple services
                ( we have to choose the architecture based on aplication and its services)

In micro services we do not use servers, we use containers.
CONTAINER: container is virtual machine without having OS
DOCKER: it is a tool used to create a container, and the container uses IMAGE which is having os&packages already installed(pre built).
                            SERVER = VM = CONTAINER
                                      
DOCKER:
      it is a open source entralized platform designed to create, deploy and run the application
      docker is written in GO language
      docker creates containers on host os to run application
      we can install docker in any os but docker engine runs natively on linux distributions.
      It allows applications to use the same Linux kernel as a system on the host computer, rather than creating a whole virtual O.S.
      Before Docker performs O.S level Virtualization also known as Containerization. process of packing application along with its dependencies.
      It was initially released in March 2013, and developed by Solomon Hykes and Sebastian Pahl.
      Docker is a set of platform-as-a-service that use O.S level Virtualization, where as VM ware uses Hardware level Virtualization.
      Container have O.S files but its negligible in size compared to original files of that O.S.
COMPONANTS:
       CLIENT: It takes the commands and executes with communication docker daemon
       HOST: The place where you installed docker.
       DAEMON: Deals with docker componets(images, containers, volumes ----). it is inside docker host.
       REGISTRY: It stores all the Images.

WORKING WITH DOCKER:
       installation:
       yum install docker -y
       systemctl restart or start docker.service
       sytemctl status docker.service
       docker --version
 DOCKER COMMANDS:
 
       docker pull ubuntu     --> to get ubuntu image form rigistry, i.e., we are getting ubuntu os image from rigistry to work
       docker images          --> to see the all images 
       docker run ubuntu       ---> to create container. but here we did not given cnt name so its takes a default name with ubuntu image
       docker run --name sairamana ubutu 
                               --> creating cnt with name and with ubuntu os image, but not entering into container
       docker run -it --sairamana2 ubuntu  
                                --> creating ctn with name and with ubuntu os image and entering into cnt.
                                -it --> interactive terminal
       docker ps -a             --> to check all containers
       docker ps                --> to check all active containers
       docker start saiamana    --> to start stopped container
       docker attach sairamana2 --> to go into a perticular container
       
 Inside a container:
       apt update -y                --> in ubuntu package manager is "apt" (advance paackage tool)
       apt install maven -y         --> install maven in sairamana2 cnt with os image ubuntu
       apt install mysql-server -y  --> creating mysql server in sairamana2 cnt   """""""'
       mkdir sai                    --> creating sai directory in sairamana2 cnt  """"""""
       touch sai/file.txt           --> creating file.txt in sai directory in sairamana2 container """""
       ( so now all above things are done in sairamana2 cnt with ubuntu os image)
        ctrl pq                       --> to exti from container.
       docekr commit sairamana2 image:v1 --> to creating a os image from sairamana2 container and whatever the informatin of sairamana2 container 
                                             will be available in "image:v1" image
       ctrl pq
       docker run -it --name sairamana4 image:v1 --> creating new container sairamana4 with os image "image:v1". and all the files and services
                                                     and etc are present in sairamana2 container will be available in sairamana4 container too
                                                     because we have taken the os image from sairamana2 cnt by comminting image:v1
                                                     (i.e., sai directory, file.txt, maven will have in sairamama4 container also)
